# Project K+
DIY, Modular, Open Source Mechanical Keyboard and Macro-Pad with per-key RGB lighting.

## Features (keep in mind they are all optional or customizable):
- Per-key RGB lighting (because that's all that matters) using WS2812(B) 5050 SMD LEDs.
- RGB compatible mechanical switches.
- Modular design: detachable Macro-Pad, arrow keys, etc. With more room for expansion. Attachable via magnets placed all over the keyboard case.
- USB-C connectors for easy hot-swapping.
- Integrated 4-port USB hub, with downstream USB-A and/or USB-C ports. If a USB-C port is connected, a USB-A port will be disconnected (on design process).
